==================================

In some parts of the Bible, the words "men," "brothers" and "sons" refer only to men. In other parts of the Bible, those words include both men and women. When the writer meant both men and women, translators need to translate it in a way that does not limit the meaning to men.

Description
---------------

In some languages a word that normally refers to men can be used to refer to both men and women. For example, the Bible sometimes says 'brothers' when it refers to both brothers and sisters.

Also in some languages, the masculine pronouns "he" and "him" can be used for any person if it is not import whether the person is a man or women. In the example below, the pronoun is "his," but it is not limited to males.

  *A wise child makes his father rejoice, but a foolish child brings grief to* **his** *mother.* (Proverbs 10:1 ULB)

Reason this is a translation issue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* In some cultures words like "man," "brother," and "son" can only be used to refer to men. If those words are used in a translation, people will think that what is being said does not apply to women.

* In some cultures, the masculine pronouns "he" and "him" can only refer to men. If a masculine pronoun is used, people will think that what is said does not apply to women.

Translation Principles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a statement applies to both men and women, translate it in such a way that people will be able to understand that.

Examples from the Bible
------------------------

  *The wise man dies just like the fool dies.* (Ecclesiastes 2:16 ULB)

    This verse does not contrast men and women. What it says is true of both men and women.

  *Then said Jesus to his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me."* (Matthew 16:24-26 ULB)

    Jesus was not talking about only men. What he said was true of both men and women.

**Caution**: Sometimes masculine words are used specifically to refer to men. Do not use words that would lead people to think that they include women. The underlined words below are specifically about men.

  *Moses said, 'If a man dies, having no children, his brother must marry his wife and have a child for his brother.'* (Matthew 22:24 ULB)

Translation Strategies
----------------------

If people would understand that that masculine words like "man," "brother," and "he" can include women, then consider using them. Otherwise, here are some ways for translating those words when they include women.

1. Use a noun that can be used for both men and women.

2. Use a word that refers to men and a word that refers to women.

3. Use pronouns that can be used for both men and women.

Examples of Translation Strategies Applied
---------------------------------------------

1. Use nouns that can be used for both men and women.

  *The wise man dies just like the fool dies.* (Ecclesiastes 2:16 ULB)

    "The wise person dies just like the fool dies."

    "Wise people die just like fools die."

2. Use a word that refers to men and a word that refers to women.

  *For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about the troubles we had in Asia* (2 Corinthians 1:8) - Paul was writing this letter to both men and women.

  "For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers and sisters, about the troubles we had in Asia" (2 Corinthians 1:8)

3. Use pronouns that can be used for both men and women.

  *If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me."* (Matthew 16:24 ULB) - English speakers can change the singular pronouns "he" "himself" and "his" to plural pronouns "they" "themselves" and "their" in order to show that it applies to all people, not just men.

  "If people want to follow me, they must deny themselves, take up their cross, and follow me."
