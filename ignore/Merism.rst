Description
-----------

Merism is a figure of speech in which a person refers to something by speaking of two extreme parts of it.

  *"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "the one who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty."* (Revelation 1:8, ULB)

  *I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.* (Revelation 22:13, ULB)

    "Alpha and Omega" is a merism that includes everything from the beginning to the end. It means eternal.

  *I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,* (Matthew 11:25 ULB)

    "Heaven and earth" is a merism that includes everything that exists.

Reason this is a translation issue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some readers may think that the phrase only applies to the items mentioned. They may not realize that it refers to those two things and everything in between.

Examples from the Bible
-----------------------

  **From the rising of the sun to its setting**, *Yahweh's name should be praised.* (Psalm 113:3 ULB)

    The bolded phrase is a merism because it speaks of the east and the west and everywhere in between. It means "everywhere."

  *He will bless those who honor him, both* **young and old**. (Psalm 115:13)

    The bolded phrase is merism because it speaks of old people and young people and everyone in between. It means "everyone."

Translation Strategies
----------------------

If the merism would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it. If not, here are other options:

1. Identify what the merism refers to without mentioning the parts.

2. Identify what the merism refers to and include the parts.
