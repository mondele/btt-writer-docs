Sentence Structure
==================

This answers the question: What are the parts of a sentence?

In order to understand this topic, it would be good to read:

`Parts of Speech <https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/PartsOfSpeech.rst>`_

**Description**

The simplest sentence structure in English includes a subject and an action word:

The boy ran.

*Subject*

The subject is who or what the sentence is about. In these examples, the subject is in bold type:

  **The boy** is running.

  **He** is running.

Subjects are typically noun phrases or pronouns. (See: Parts of Speech) In the examples above, "the boy" is a noun phrase that has the noun 'boy,' and "he" is a pronoun.

When the sentence is a command, it usually does not have a subject pronoun. People understand that the subject is "you."

  Close the door.

*Predicate*

The predicate is the part of a sentence that tells something about the subject. It usually has a verb. (See: Verbs) In the sentences below, the subjects are "the man" and "he."

  The man is strong.

      Predicate: is strong     

      Verb: is

  He worked hard.
    
    Predicate: worked hard    
    
    Verb: worked

  He made a garden.
    
    Predicate: made a garden  
    
    Verb: made

**Compound Sentences**

A sentence can be made up of more than one sentence. Each of the two lines below has a subject and a predicate and is a full sentence.

  He planted the yams.

  His wife planted the corn.

The compound sentence below has the two sentences above. In English, compound sentences are joined with a conjunction such as "and," "but," or "or".

  He planted the yams and his wife planted the corn.

**Clauses**

Sentences can also have clauses and other phrases. Clauses are like sentences because they have a subject and a predicate, but they do not normally occur by themselves. Here are some examples of clauses. 

  when the corn was ready
  
      Subject: the corn
    Predicate: was ready

  after she picked it
  
      Subject: she
    Predicate: picked it
 
  because it tasted so good
  
      Subject: it
    Predicate: tasted so good

Clauses are usually only part of a sentence. The clauses in the sentences below are in bold type.

  **When the corn was ready**, she picked it.

  **After she picked it**, she carried it home and cooked it.

  Then she and her husband ate it all, **because it tasted so good**.

The following phrases can be a whole sentence.
  
  She picked it.
  
  She carried it home and cooked it.
  
  Then she and her husband ate it all.

**Note:** We are using the word clause for 'dependent clause' and sentence for 'independent clause.'

**Relative Clauses**

In some languages, clauses can be used with a noun that is part of a sentence. These are called relative clauses.

In the sentence below, "the corn that was ready" is part of the predicate of the whole sentence. The relative clause "that he had planted" is used with the noun "corn" to tell which corn she picked.

  His wife picked the corn that was ready.

In the sentence below "his mother, who was very annoyed" is part of the predicate of the whole sentence. The relative clause "who was very annoyed" is used with the noun "mother" to tell how her mother felt when she did not get any corn.

  She did not give any corn to her mother, who was very annoyed.

**Translation Issues**

Languages have different orders for the parts of a sentence.

Some languages do not have relative clauses, or they use them in a limited way. (See: `Distinguishing versus Informing or Reminding <https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/Distinguishing.rst>`_)
