Generic Noun Phrases
=====================

This answers the question: What are generic noun phrases and how can I translate them?

In order to understand this topic, it would be good to read:

Generic noun phrases refer to people or things in general rather than to specific individuals or things.

  *The* **one who does what is right** *is kept away from trouble and it comes upon* **the wicked** *instead.* (Proverbs 11:8 ULB) 
  
The bolded phrases above do not refer to any specific people but to anyone who does what is right or anyone who is wicked.

Different languages have different ways of showing that a phrase refers to something in general. Translators should use ways of doing this that are natural in their language.

Description
-----------

Generic noun phrases refers to people or things in general rather than to specific individuals or things. This happens frequently in proverbs, because proverbs tell about things that are true about people in general.

  *Can* **a man** *walk on hot coals without scorching his feet?*

  *So is* **the man who goes into his neighbor's wife;**

  **the one who has relations with her** *will not go unpunished.* (Proverbs 6:28 ULB)

The bolded phrases above do not refer to a specific man. They refer to any man who does these things.

Reason this is a translation issue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Different languages have different ways of showing that noun phrases refer to something in general. Translators should refer to these general ideas in ways that are natural in their language.

Examples from the Bible
-----------------------

  *People curse* **the man who refuses to sell them grain** (Proverbs 11:26 ULB)
  
    This does not refer to a particular man, but to any person who refuses to sell grain.

  *Yahweh gives favor to* **a good man,** *but he condemns* **a man who makes evil plans**. (Proverbs 12:2 ULB) 

    The phrase "a good man" does not refer to a particular man, but to any person who is good. The phrase "a man who makes evil plans" does not refer to a particular man, but to any person who makes evil plans.

Translation Strategies
----------------------

If your language can use the same wording as in the ULB to refer to people or things in generalâ€¯rather than to specific individuals or things, consider using the same wording. Here are some strategies you might use.

1. Use the word "the" in the noun phrase.

2. Use the word "a" in the noun phrase.

3. Use the word "any," as in "any person" or "anyone."

4. Use the plural form, as in "people."

5. Use any other way that is natural in your language.

Examples of Translation Strategies Applied
------------------------------------------

1. Use the word "the" in the noun phrase.

  *Yahweh gives favor to* **a good man,** *but he condemns* **a man who makes evil plans**. (Proverbs 12:2 ULB)

    "Yahweh gives favor to the good man, but he condemns the man who makes evil plans." (Proverbs 12:2)

The following examples show how the strategies may be applied to a noun phrase that has "the" in it. Use the strategy that is most natural in your language:

  People curse **the man** who refuses to sell them grain. (Proverbs 11:26 ULB)
  
2. Use the word "a" in the noun phrase.

  "People curse **a man** *who refuses to sell them grain"
  
3. Use the word "any," as in "any person" or "anyone."

  "People curse **any man** who refuses to sell them grain"

4. Use the plural form, as in "people" (or in this sentence, "men").

"People curse **men** who refuse to sell them grain"

5. Use any other way that is natural in your language.

  "People curse **whoever** refuses to sell them grain."
