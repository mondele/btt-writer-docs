Verbs
=====

This answers the question: What are verbs and what kinds of things are associated with them?

In order to understand this topic, it would be good to read:

`Parts of Speech <https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/PartsOfSpeech.rst>`_

Description
-----------

Verbs are words that refer to an action or event or that are used in describing or identifying things. The verbs in the examples below are in bold type.

  John **ran**. ("Run" is an action.)

  John **ate** a banana. ("Eat" is an action.)

  John **saw** Mark. ("See" is an event.)

  John **died**. ("Die" is an event.)

  John **is** tall. (The phrase "is tall" describes John. The word "is" is a verb that links "John" with "tall".)

  John **looks** handsome. (The phrase "is handsome" describes John. The word "looks" here is a verb that links "John" with "handsome.")

  John **is** my brother. (The phrase "is my brother" identifies John.)

People or Things Associated with a Verb
----------------------------------------

A verb usually says something about someone or something. All of the example sentences above say something about John. "John" is the **subject** of those sentences. In English the subject usually comes before the verb.

Sometimes there is another person or thing associated with the verb. In English the object usually comes after the verb.

  He ate lunch.
  
    Verb: ate
    
    Object: lunch

  He sang a song.
  
    Verb: sang
    
    Object: a ng
    
  He read a book.
  
    Verb: read
    
    Object: a book
    
  He saw the book.
    
    Verb: sae
    
    Object: the book
    
Some verbs never have an object.

  The sun rose at six o'clock.

  John slept well.

  John fell yesterday.
  
In English, it is sometimes alright to leave out the object when the object is not important in the sentence.

  He never eats at night.

  He sings all the time.

  He reads well.

  He cannot see.

In some languages, a verb that needs an object must always take one, even if the object is not very important. People who speak those languages might say the sentences above like this.

  He never eats food at night.
    
    Verb: eats
    
    Object: food
    
  He sings songs all the time.
    
    Verb: sings
    
    Object: songs
    
  He reads words well.
    
    Verb: reads
    
    Object: words
    
  He cannot see anything.
    
    Verb: see
    
    Object: anything
    
Subject and Object Marking on Verbs
-----------------------------------
In some languages, the verb may be a little bit different depending on the persons or things associated with it. For example, English speakers sometimes put "s" at the end of the verb when the subject is just one person. In other languages marking on the verb may show whether the subject is "I," "you," or "he"; singular or plural; or male or female.

  They **eat** bananas every day. (The subject "they" is more than one person.)
  
  John **eats** bananas every day. (The subject "John" is one person.)
  
Time and Tense
--------------

When we tell about an event, we usually tell whether it is in the past, the present, or the future. Sometimes we do this with words like "yesterday," "now," or "tomorrow."

In some languages the verb may be a little bit different depending on the time associated with it. This kind of marking on a verb is called **tense**. English speakers sometimes put "ed" at the end of the verb when the event happened in the past.

  Sometimes Mary **cooks** meat.
  
  Yesterday Mary **cooked** meat. (She did this in the past.)
  
In some languages speakers might add a word to tell something about the time. English speakers use the word "will" when the verb refers to something in the future.

  Tomorrow Mary **will cook** meat.

Aspect
-------

When we tell about an event, we usually show whether or not we are thinking about how the event progressed over a period of time, and whether or not the event is still relevant when something else happens. This is **aspect**. English speakers sometimes use the verbs "is" or "has" and adds "s," "ing," or "ed" to the end of the verb.

  Mary **cook**s meat every day. (This tell about something Mary often does.)
  
  Mary **is cooking** the meat. (This tells about something Mary is in the process of doing right now.)
  
  Mary **cooked** the meat, and John **came** home. (This simply tells about things that Mary and John did.)
  
  While Mary **was cooking** the meat, John **came** home. (This tells about something Mary was in the process of doing when John came home)
  
  Mary **has cooked** the meat, and she wants us to come eat it. (This tells about something Mary did that is still relevant now.)
  
  Mary **had cooked** the meat by the time John came home. (This tells about something that Mary completed in the past before something else happened.)
