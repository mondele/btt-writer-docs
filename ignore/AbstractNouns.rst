Abstract Nouns
==============

This answers the question: What are abstract nouns and how do I deal with them in my translation?

In order to understand this topic, it would be good to read:

Abstract nouns are nouns that refer to attitudes, qualities, events, situations, or even to relationships among these ideas. These are things that cannot be seen or touched in a physical sense, such as happiness, weight, injury, unity, friendship, health, and reason. This is a translation issue because some languages may express a certain idea with an abstract noun, while others would need a different way to express it. For example, "What is its weight?" could be expressed as "How much does it weigh?" or "How heavy is it?"

Description
------------

Remember that nouns are words that refer to a person, place, thing, or idea. ABSTRACT NOUNS are nouns that refer to attitudes, qualities, events, situations, or even to relationships among these ideas. These are things that cannot be seen or touched in a physical sense, such as joy, peace, creation, goodness, contentment, justice, truth, freedom, vengeance, slowness, length, and weight.

Abstract nouns allow us to express thoughts about ideas in fewer words than if we did not have those nouns. For example, we can say, "I believe in the forgiveness of sin." But if English did not have the two abstract nouns "forgiveness" and "sin," then we would have to make a longer sentence to express the same meaning. We would have to say, for example, "I believe that God is willing to forgive people after they have sinned."

Abstract nouns also allow us to refer to a situation without telling more details about it than we want to tell. For example, we can say "I got here late because there was an accident on the highway." "Accident" is an abstract noun. If it does not matter whose accident it was, or what kind of accident it was, then it can be better if I do not have to say these things about it.

Reason this is a translation issue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Bible that you translate from may use abstract nouns to express certain ideas. Your language might not use abstract nouns for some of those ideas; instead, it might use phrases to express those ideas. Those phrases will have other kinds of words such as adjectives, verbs, or adverbs, that express some of the meaning in the abstract noun.

Examples from the Bible
-----------------------

  *from childhood you have known the sacred writings* (2 Timothy 3:15 ULB)

    The abstract noun "childhood" refers to when someone is a child.

  *But godliness with contentment is great gain.* (1 Timothy 6:6 ULB)

    The abstract nouns "godliness" and "contentment" refer to being godly and content. The abstract noun "gain" refers to something that benefits or helps someone.

  *Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.* (Luke 19:9 ULB)

    The abstract noun "salvation" here refers to being saved.

  *The Lord does not move slowly concerning his promises, as some consider slowness to be* (2 Peter 3:9 ULB)

    The abstract noun "slowness" refers how slowly something is done.

  *He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the purposes of the heart.* (1 Corinthians 4:5 ULB)

    The abstract noun "purposes" refers to the things that people want to do and the reasons they want to do them.

Translation Strategies
-------------------------

If an abstract noun would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it. If not, here is another option:

Reword the sentence with a phrase that expresses the meaning of the abstract noun.
