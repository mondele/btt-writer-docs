===========

This answers the question: What does the word synecdoche mean?

In order to understand this topic, it would be good to read:

`Figures of Speech <https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/FiguresOfSpeech.rst>`_

Synecdoche is when a speaker uses a part of something to refer to the whole or uses the whole to refer to a part.

Description
------------

Synecdoche is when a speaker uses a part of something to refer to the whole or uses the whole to refer to a part.

  *My soul exalts the Lord.* (Luke 1:46 ULB)
  
      Mary was was very happy about what the Lord was doing, so she said "my soul", the part of herself that has emotions, to refer to her whole self.

  *the Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing something that is not lawful ...?"* (Mark 2:24 ULB)

    The Pharisees who were standing there did not all say the same words at the same time. Instead, it is more likely that one man representing the group said those words.

Reasons this is a translation issue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Some readers may understand the words literally.

* Some readers may realize that they are not to understand the words literally, but they may not know what the meaning is.

Example from the Bible
----------------------

  *I looked on all the deeds that my hands had accomplished* (Ecclesiastes 2:11 ULB)

    "My hands" is a synecdoche for the whole person, because clearly the legs and the rest of the body and the mind were also involved.

Translation Strategy
----------------------

If the synecdoche would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it. If not, here is another option:

State specifically what the synecdoche refers to.
