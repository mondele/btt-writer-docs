Statements - Other Uses
========================

This answers the question: What other uses are there for statements?

In order to understand this, it would be good to read

`Sentence Types <https://github.com/unfoldingWord-dev/translationStudio-Info/blob/master/docs/SentenceTypes.rst>`_

Description
------------

Normally statements are used to give information. Sometimes they are used in the Bible for other functions.

Reason this is a translation issue: Some languages would not use a statement for some of the functions that statements are used for in the Bible.

Examples from the Bible
------------------------

Statements are normally used to give information. All of the sentences in John 1:6-8 below are statements, and their function is to give information.

  *There was a man who was sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify about the light, that all might believe through him. John was not the light, but came that he might testify about the light.* (John 1:6-8 ULB)
  
A statement can also be used as a command to tell someone what to do. In the examples below, the high priest used statements with the verb "will" to tell people what to do.

  *He commanded them, saying, "This is what you must do. A third of you who come on the Sabbath will keep watch over the king's house, and a third will be at the Sur Gate, and a third at the gate behind the guardhouse."* (2 Kings 11:5 ULB)

A statement can also be used to give instructions. The speaker below was not just telling Joseph about something Joseph would do in the future; he was telling Joseph what to do.

  *She will give birth to a son, and you will call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.* (Matthew 1:21 ULB)
  
A statement can also be used to make a request. The man with leprosy was not just saying what Jesus was able to do. He was asking Jesus to heal him.

  *Behold, a leper came to him and bowed before him, saying, "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean."* (Matthew 8:2 ULB)
  
A statement can also be used to perform something. By telling Adam that the ground was cursed because of him, God actually cursed it.

  *cursed is the ground because of you;* (Genesis 3:17 ULB)
  
By telling a man that his sins were forgiven, Jesus forgave the man's sins.

  *Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."* (Luke 2:5 ULB)

Translation Strategies
------------------------

1. If the function of a statement would not be understood correctly in your language, use a sentence type that would express that function.

2. If the function of a statement would not be understood correctly in your language, add a sentence type that would express that function.

3. If the function of a statement would not be understood correctly in your language, use a verb form that would express that function.

Examples of Translation Strategies Applied
------------------------------------------

1. If the function of a statement would not be understood correctly in your language, use a sentence type that would express that function.

  *She will give birth to a son, and you will call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.* (Matthew 1:21 ULB) The phrase "you will call his name Jesus" is an instruction. It can be translated as a command.

    "She will give birth to a son. Call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.

2. If the function of a statement would not be understood correctly in your language, add a sentence type that would express that function.

  *Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.* (Matthew 8:2 ULB) The function of "you can make me clean" is to make a request.

    "Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean. Please do so."

    "Lord, if you are willing, please make me clean. I know you can do so."

3. If the function of a statement would not be understood correctly in your language, use a verb form that would express that function.

  *She will give birth to a son, and you will call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.* (Matthew 1:21 ULB)

    "She will give birth to a son, and you must call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.

  *Son, your sins are forgiven.* (Luke 2:5 ULB)

    "Son, I forgive your sins."
