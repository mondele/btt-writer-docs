Translating Translation Notes for Gateway Languages Using BTT Writer
==========================================================================================

**NOTE**: These instructions assume that the Bible ULB text project and the Bible ULB Notes project have been previously set-up and that the Gateway Language check box is checked in Settings.

Workspace
------------

The white square or rectangle boxes are known as cards. Each of the cards in a row contains the information pertaining to the same chunk, or part of, the chapter.

Navigation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

On the left in the green bar are the navigation tools. Here is the action when each is used:

* Top up-arrow against line –  go to the beginning of the book

* Open up-arrow (chevron) – back one chapter in the book (the navigation is up or before in the book)

* Closed up-arrow – back one chunk in the book (or before in the book than the top chunk shown)

* White box – type in the chapter number, press enter, to go directly to that chapter.

* Closed down-arrow – forward one chunk in the book (or after in the book than the top chunk shown)

* Open down-arrow (chevron) – forward one chapter in the book (the navigation is down or later in the book)

* Top down-arrow against line – go to the end of the book

Columns
^^^^^^^

1st column – This is the English ULB source text. Use this as a reference tool or guide on what the notes or questions are referring to.

2nd column – This is the Gateway Language translation of the book. The verses on the card of this translation should align with the verses on the English card.

3rd column – This is the working column

4th column – Tabs with the resources for the English ULB.
 
**HINT**: You might want to arrange the window so that the right 2 columns are visible at the same time.

**HINT**: You might want to scroll the rows of cards so that the row being worked on is placed at the top of the window.
 
To work in the 3rd column:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.      To create a new card - click the plus sign located on the top bar on the right side. Notice that the first card can be created by clicking on the plus sign in the middle of the gray space in the row.

2.      To delete a card – click on the X in the top right of the card.

3.      To move a card up or down on the row - click on the up or down triangle arrows.  Note that cards cannot be moved from one row to another.
 

Terms used:
^^^^^^^^^^^

**Reference Text** - This is the text copied from the Gateway Language biblical text. It is on the red line. It can also be known as a snippet.

**Translation Academy link** - This is the information that is in parenthesis at the end of some notes. For example: (See: figs_inclusive)

To translate Notes:
-------------------

The blue words in the notes should be the exact same words as in the translated text in column 2 and placed above the thin red line of the 3rd column card. See step 3 below for further information. 

**NOTE**: sometimes there will be ‘General Information’ or ‘Connecting Statement’ instead of the quote from the passage. This phrase is to be translated above the red line.

The information about the scripture quote (words in black font) are translated on the lines under the thin red line.
 
Process:
^^^^^^^^^

1. Click on the ‘Notes’ (default view) tab in the 4th column.

2. Click the plus sign in the 3rd column to create a new card.

3. Choose a note to translate:

  * Note that the words in blue (snippet) that you are looking at should be a direct quote from the English ULB.

  * Find the corresponding section of text in the Gateway Language ULB text (in the 2nd column).

  ( Select the words, copy and paste in the space above the thin red line - over the words ‘reference text.’ (Copy and paste by using key strokes or by clicking and dragging.)

4. Click on the note (blue words) to see the helpful information on how to translate the text

5. Translate the note content on the 3rd column card under the thin red line.

6. If there is a parenthesis (a Translation Academy link), copy and paste the entire parenthesis at the end of the translation on the card.

  * You may translate only the word ‘see’ that is inside the parenthesis.

  * Leave all the other words or characters in English.
 
**HINT**: for chunks/rows that have a long list of notes or questions - you might want to start at the bottom note or question and work upwards on the list. Each new notecard will need to be moved up above the previous card. This process will keep the source text, English note content and the translated work on the same horizontal plane.
 
Frequently Asked Questions:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**May I change a note so that it makes sense in my language?**

Often, the ULB in the target Gateway Language will say things in a different way than the ULB said them in English. In order for the translationNote to be useful in the target Gateway Language, you will need to adapt the translationNote so that it talks about the text of the ULB as it is in the Gateway Language translation. This means that you will need to copy the phrase of the Gateway ULB that is the translation of the same phrase from the English ULB into the translationNote, and then sometimes change the translationNote so that it makes sense and is helpful for the Other Language translator who will use these translationNotes as translation tools.


**May I delete a note that does not apply to my language?**

Because languages can be very different from each other, sometimes there will be translationNotes that are important and necessary for some languages, but that are not needed for other languages. If there is a translationNote that does not make sense when applied to the ULB text in the target Gateway Language, then you as the translator will need to modify the translationNote so that it does make sense in relation to the ULB in your target Gateway Language. If the translationNote does not apply at all to the target GL text of the ULB, then you may delete that note from your translation of the translationNotes. But be sure to think about it very carefully before you delete a translationNote, to be sure that it is not necessary for the GL translation.


**May I add a note that would help with translation in my language?**

For the same reason, sometimes you will realize that the Other Language translator will need a translationNote in order to understand a phrase in the target Gateway Language ULB, but there might not be a translationNote already written for that phrase, because it was not necessary for the English ULB. In that case, you will need to write a new translationNote and include it in your translation. Usually these translationNotes will be to explain a phrase or way of saying something that is normal in the Gateway Language but that is not normal in the Other Languages that you know of. When writing your translationNote, follow the same style and format of the existing translationNotes.

Remember that speakers of many different languages will be using these Gateway Language translationNotes to help them translate the Bible. There will be many things that you will understand about the Bible in the Gateway Language that the OL translator may not understand. For that reason, if you think that there is something difficult to understand in the GL ULB, write a translationNote that can help the OL translator to understand it. There will probably be many Other Language translators who will benefit from reading the translationNote and who will make a better translation because of it.

Formatting the translated Notes:
--------------------------------

How to work with links in the notes:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two types of links in the translationNotes: links to a translationAcademy topic page and links for repeated words or phrases within the same book.

**translationAcademy Topics**

Each translationNote follows a phrase from the ULB and will provide immediate help on how to translate that phrase. Sometimes there will be a statement in parenthesis at the end of the suggested translation that may look like this: (See: figs_metaphor). The word or words in blue are a link to a translationAcademy topic. 

It is important to copy and paste the parenthesis and the information inside of the parenthesis to the note card in column 3. To do this, highlight the entire parenthesis and left-click-hold-drag it to the card.  If you desire you may translate the word ‘see.’

**Repeated Phrases in a Book**

Sometimes a phrase is used multiple times in one book. When this happens, there will be a link in the translationNotes-blue chapter and verse numbers that you can click on-that will take you back to where you have translated that phrase before. 

It is important to copy and paste the parenthesis and the information inside of the parenthesis to the note card in column 3. To do this, highlight the entire parenthesis and left-click-hold-drag it to the card. 

Formatting the reference text (the snippet):
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The reference text should be the exact same text as displayed in the Gateway Language translation note. Occasionally the snippet in the English notes will have ellipsis (three dots) between words or phrases. There are several reasons for this:

1.  The note only has information about the words shown and no information on the words not shown. As in these examples:

    The text states:

    *The clans of the Libnites and the Shimeites come from Gershon. These are the clans of the Gershonites.*

    The note has information only about the names in the passage so states:

      **Libnites ... Shimeites ... Gershonites** - "Libnites" and "Shimeites" are the name of clans, named after the head of their family. The "Gershonites" is the name of people who descended from Gershon. (See: How to Translate Names)

    The text states:

    * God put all things under Christ's feet and gave him to the church as head over all things. The church is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.*

    The note has information only about the head and body so states:

      **head ... his body** - Just as with a human body, the head rules all things pertaining to its body, so Christ is the head of the church body. (See: Metaphor)

2. The snippet could be very long so the words in the middle are removed.

  The text states:
 
    *Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to God's holy people in Ephesus*

  The note states:

    **Paul, an apostle ... to God's holy people in Ephesus** - Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter and its intended audience. AT: "I, Paul, an apostle ... write this letter to you, God's holy people in Ephesus" 

**How to format snippets with ellipsis**: You, the Gateway Language translator, should understand the purpose of the ellipsis and then decide to format the snippet accordingly. If you prefer to not make the decision on what text to omit, then keep all the text in the snippet.
