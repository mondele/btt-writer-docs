A footnote is additional text that usually appears at the bottom of a book’s page and is referenced within the page.

In BTT Writer, a footnote is shown as a black page icon that you click to display the footnote. For example, there is a footnote in 1 Cor. 10:28.

Footnotes can provide further explanation when:

* There are proper names, words or terms that differ between various Bible versions

* There are missing words or verses in the ULB. (There may be text in one Bible version that is not present in the ULB.)

To translate a footnote:
************************

1)	Copy the footnote.

    *	In the source text, click the footnote icon to open it (for example, in 1 Cor. 10:28)  

    * Highlight the text of the footnote.

    *	Copy the footnote text – [Ctrl + C] on Windows.

    * Dismiss the footnote.
 
2)	Paste the footnote into the translated text.

    * If the chunk has been marked “done”, click the toggle at bottom right of the translated chunk.
 
    * Click the Edit icon (pencil).
 
    * Click the appropriate spot in the translated text.

    * Paste the footnote text – [Ctrl + V] on Windows).
 
3)	Add footnote coding. Footnote coding identifies the text as a footnote and separates it from the surrounding text. To add footnote coding:

    * Type the following text at the beginning of the footnote, separated from the surrounding text by spaces:

      ::
 
         \f + \ft

    * Type the following text at the end of the footnote, separated from the surrounding text by spaces: 
 
      ::
 
          \f* 
 
    * If there is a quote within the footnote:
      
      * Replace the beginning quotation mark with: 
      
        ::
            
           \fqa
           
        and separate from the surrounding text by spaces.
      
      *	Replace the ending quotation mark with: 
      
        ::
            
           \fqb
           
        and separate from the surrounding text by spaces. 
 
4)	Translate the footnote text.

    * Translate the text of the footnote.
 
    * Click the check mark to save the edits on the chunk.
 
    * Mark the chunk as done.
    
For example, the code for the chunk containing the footnote in 1 Cor. 10:28 looks like this:

::

    \v 28 But if someone says to you, "This food was from a pagan sacrifice," do not eat it. This is 
    for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience. \f + \ft Some ancient 
    copies of the Greek text add, \fqa For the earth and everything in it belong to the Lord. \fqb But 
    the best copies of the Greek text do not have this. Many scholars see this addition as a
    duplication of verse 26 \f* \v 29 I do not mean your own conscience, but the other person's conscience. 
    For why should my freedom be judged by another's conscience? \v 30 If I partake of the meal with 
    gratitude, why am I being insulted for that for which I gave thanks?
