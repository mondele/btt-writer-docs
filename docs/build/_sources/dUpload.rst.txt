When you work in BTT Writer, your text is saved every five minutes to your computer. Your work is not saved to the server (WACS or DCS) until you explicitly upload it.

While you are in a project in BTT Writer, click the 3-dot icon to access the options menu. Select Upload/Export (the upward arrow icon  ). 

**Note**: The upload/export option is not available in the 3-dot menu on the home screen, but is available only from the project screen.
 
There are four options to choose from when exporting from BTT Writer.
 
Upload to the Server
----------------------------

This requires an Internet connection.

This option copies your work to the online Wycliffe Associates or Door43 server, making it available to be downloaded by other translators, merged with other projects, or used as an online backup. The server to which you upload is specified in the Server Suite setting (see `Advanced Settings <https://btt-writer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dSettings.html#advanced-settings>`_).

You can upload to the content server only if you have an internet connection and are logged in to your server account.

Follow this process to upload to the server:

1.	When you are in a project, click the 3-dot menu.

2.	Click the bar Upload to Server.
 
3.	Wait while the upload process takes place.
 
4.	If you are connected to the Internet and signed into your server account, you will receive an "Upload Complete" message. 
 
  *	The message displays a link to the online repository of the file.

  * Click the link to open the repository, OR click Close to close the window.

5.	If you are NOT connected to the Internet, you will receive be an "Upload Failed" message. 
 
  *	Click Close to close the window.
