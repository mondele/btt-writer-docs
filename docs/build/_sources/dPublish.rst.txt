Self-Publishing
---------------

When you upload your work to the content server it is automatically available online under your user account. This is referred to as self-publishing. You can upload to the server as often as you wish to create a backup of your work. (See `Upload/Export Your Work <https://github.com/WycliffeAssociates/btt-writer-docs/blob/master/docs/dUpload.rst>`_.) 

You can access a web version of your project at:

* For Door43 (DCS): http://door43.org/u/user_name/project_name (where user_name is your user name and project_name is your translation project). BTT Writer gives you the correct link when you upload. You can also browse all works on http://door43.org.

* For WACS: https://wacs.bibletranslationtools.org/user_name/project_name (where user_name is your user name and project_name is your translation project). BTT Writer gives you the correct link when you upload. Click **See in Reader** to see a read-friendly version of your project.

From your Door43 or WACS project page you can:

*	See the web version of your project with default formatting

*	Download documents of your project (like a PDF)

*	Download the source files (USFM) for your project

*   View or print warning and error messages

*	Interact with others about your project

Source Text Publishing
----------------------

Source text publishing is required for all Gateway Languages so that they can be used as source texts by Other Languages. Note that this process applies only to Gateway Languages. There are several steps to the process of publishing your work. 

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before a Gateway Language translation can become a source text, the following prerequisites must all be met:

*	Whole Resource - The whole resource must be translated and checked to the required level. Parts of resources (e.g. half of the Open Bible Stories, only a few chapters of a book of the Bible) cannot be published.

*	Checking - A translation must have reached the appropriate checking level. For Bible translations, this is checking level 3: https://bibleineverylanguage.org/faq/.

•	On the content server – The server must have the version that will be published. If the work was done on multiple devices, then it may need to be merged together. Get the help of a Content Tech to make merging easier (either email `help@door43.org <mailto:helpdoor43.org>`_ for Door43 or `helpdesk@techadvancement.com <mailto:helpdesk@techadvancement.com>`_ for WACS).

*	Agreements - Everyone involved in the translation and checking must have agreed to the Statement of Faith, the Translation Guidelines, and the Open License. This can be done either by creating Door43 accounts or by physically signing the documents and digitizing them (scanning or photos). See http://ufw.io/forms for downloadable agreement forms.

Reviewing the Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use BTT Writer to ensure that the project is complete and that all contributors are listed. You can perform project review by completing the following steps to publish your work:

1.	In BTT Writer, load your project.

2.	Click the 3-dot icon to access the options menu.

3.	Click Project Review (the double check marks icon).

    *	Click the Project tab -- Review sections of the book for final review. 

      1.	We suggest that you review any chunk that has a review button. These are chunks that are not marked done.

      2.	Click the Review button to finish translating, or set the verse markers and then slide the 'done' toggle.

    *	Click the Contributors tab -- This is where you enter who translated the work. Remember that the names will be publicly available.

      1.	Click the Name or Pseudonym line and enter a contributor’s name, or their pseudonym if they do not wish their name to be published. 
 
      2.	Click the check box to indicate that this person has agreed to the terms of use.
      
      3.    Click Add Contributor to add the translator.
 
      4.    When you have finished adding contributors, click Next to continue.


    •	When you either click Next in the step above, or click the Upload/Export tab, you are presented with Upload/Export Options. 

      1.	Select Upload to Server (requires an Internet connection). Note: The server to which the project will be uploaded in the one specified in the  Server Suite setting -- see `BTT Writer for the Desktop: Modifying Program Settings <https://btt-writer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dSettings.html>`_.

      2.	A pop-up message appears after a successful upload. This pop-up message includes the repository that the translation is in on the content server. 

      3.	Click the link to view the repository. If you are viewing the WACS server, click "See in Reader" for a read-friendly view.

Source Text Request Form
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once you have the prerequisites, you may fill out the source text request form at http://ufw.io/pub/. A few notes about the form:

*	You must have a server account to create a request.

*	You must include the names or pseudonyms of everyone involved. You must also include their server usernames if you are not attaching signed license agreements for them.

*	Note that the information you enter will be public and will become a part of the front matter of the source text.

After you submit the form, you will be contacted if anything is missing. Once the request has been approved, it will go into the publishing queue where a developer will work to make the translation a source text. You may also be contacted by the developer if there are any issues encountered during the publishing process. You will be notified when the process is completed and you may review a PDF of the work.

Questions Regarding the Request to Publish Form and Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**What Happens After Text is Approved?**

When the Request to Publish is approved, the text is made available on https://bibleineverylanguage.org/translations/ for online viewing, as a downloadable, print-ready PDF.

**Can Text Be Changed After Level 3 Checking?**

Approved text can always be modified in BTT Writer even after all checking levels are completed, HOWEVER if you or another user were to submit a Request to Publish for text that has already completed Level 3 checking, there would be questions regarding the reason for overwriting the previously published and checked materials. The approver will look to see who contributed to the change and may contact the requestor and others involved with the translation of the text in question to ensure the changes are valid.

**Must All Contributors Be Named?**

Due to copyright laws (and these exist no matter what country you are in and no matter what people tell you about laws in that country), you must list every contributor as they prefer to be mentioned.  Normally this is the person's name or pseudonym.
